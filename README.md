Development Guide
-----------------

I followed [this guide](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python) for creating a Python Flask app which would run on Heroku. However, you probably don't need to mess with that. Just install [nosetests](https://nose.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) and run *nosetests* in the *dmst-temp-repo* folder. It will run all the tests in *_tests.py* files and you can write more tests or write code to fix the tests that fail.

Alternatively, you can work on the HTML/CSS/JS to get D3 working.
